# Ideas for the final project

1. Apply a method from this class to a research problem that you are working on.
2. Create a long-horizon billiards shot engine https://youtu.be/vsTTXYxydOE
3. Create a (PO)MDP model of a skiing robot and find a decent descent solution.
4. Re-produce the results from a reinforcement learning paper and run at least one extra experiment that is not in the paper.
5. Build a DESPOT solver without determinization and compare it to the determinized version to quantify the value of determinization
6. Contribute a solver to POMDPs.jl or ReinforcementLearning.jl (a submission of this type should be able to reliably solve simple problems, conform to the interface, and have tests that pass)
7. Create a fast GPU Monte Carlo simulator for POMDPs.jl

You can also find a large number of examples of projects from a similar course at Standord here: https://web.stanford.edu/class/aa228/cgi-bin/wp/old-projects/
